# Vira Mobile Bank - Admin Panel
Vira Mobile Bank is a financial services application designed for foreign nationals residing in Iran. My role in this project was to develop the admin panel for managing users and their financial activities.
I built the admin panel using Vue.js 3, leveraging Vuetify (based on Bootstrap) for the UI design to ensure a clean and responsive user experience.

Challenges & Solutions:

Complex and large-scale application: Managing numerous pages and vast amounts of data efficiently.

Role-based access control: Implementing different admin roles with varying levels of permissions.

This project enhanced my ability to handle large-scale admin panels, optimize UI/UX for financial applications, and implement advanced access management systems.
